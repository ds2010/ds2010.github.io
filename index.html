    <p> I am a Ph.D student in the Management Science unit, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://people.aalto.fi/timo.kuosmanen">Timo Kuosmanen</a>, 
      at  <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/school-of-business">Aalto University School of Business</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of 
      nonparametric econometrics, optimization, and production economics and their applications to resources and environmental fields. I will graduate in June 2022. 
      Befor joining Aalto University BIZ, I earned my MSc. degree in Management Science from <a href="https://www.cug.edu.cn">China University of Geosciences</a>.</p>
