      <a href="https://github.com/ds2010/pyStoNED">pyStoNED</a> is a Python package that provides functions for estimating Convex Nonparametric Least Square (CNLS), 
      Stochastic Nonparametric Envelopment of Data (StoNED), and other various StoNED-related variants such as 
      Convex Quantile Regression (CQR), Convex Expectile Regression (CER), and Isotonic CNLS (ICNLS). 
      It also provides efficiency measurement using Data Envelopement Analysis (DEA) and Free Disposal Hull (FDH). 
      The pyStoNED package allows the user to estimate the CNLS/StoNED frontiers in an open-access 
      environment and is built based on the <a href="http://www.pyomo.org/">Pyomo</a>.

      Along with the development of the <a href="https://github.com/ds2010/pyStoNED">pyStoNED</a> package, 
      we recognize that we can reformulate the CNLS problem and use other Python packages, e.g., CVXOPT,
      to solve it. More discussions can be seen from <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/ds2010/CNLS-Python/blob/master/CNLS-tutorials/CNLS-reformulation.ipynb">CNLS-reformulation</a>.
      Thus, this project provides some basic functions (e.g., CNLS_CRS and CNLS_VRS) and a tutorial to help users recode the CNLS in Python.
