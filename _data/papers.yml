    abstract: Effective evaluation facilitates the implementation of production quota policy and establishment 
              of future policy directions. However, reliable evaluations of the long-term impacts of production quota 
              policies on critical minerals remain scant. In this study, we first derive hypotheses about the production 
              quota policy and sustainable supply capacity of critical minerals. Based on the theoretical analysis, 
              we apply the generalized synthetic control method to a balanced panel of critical minerals for the years 1999–2017 
              to analyze the average policy effect and the effects for different minerals. Subsequently, we explain why the policy
              lacks lasting effects on the economic performance. Our main findings are that the effects of the production quota
              policy that are not obvious in the initial stage become significant at a later stage and that implementing the policy 
              effectively can lower the supply disruption risk. With policy implementation and an increase in supervision intensity,
              the production quota policy has a positive impact on improving the sustainable supply capacity for critical minerals
              but a negative effect on profitability, thereby causing a horizontal change or even decline in the policy effects in
              the long term. Policy implications are proposed to enhance the sustainable supply capacity of critical minerals for 
              China and other countries seeking supply security.

    abstract: Evaluation of abatement costs is critical in setting reduction goals and devising climate policy. 
              However, reliable forward-looking assessment of the short-term effects of climate policy remains a major challenge. 
              Using panel data of 30 Chinese provinces during 1997–2015, we first estimate the marginal CO2 abatement costs using 
              a novel data-driven approach, convex quantile regression. Based on the marginal abatement cost estimates and China's 
              plans regarding carbon intensity reduction and economic growth, we present a forward-looking assessment of the abatement 
              costs for Chinese provinces for 2016–2020. Our main finding is that all the Chinese provinces have a negative abatement 
              cost, which means these provinces can benefit from an increase in the absolute level of CO2 emissions despite the constraint
              on carbon intensity. The magnitudes of economic benefits exhibit a significant regional disparity because some provinces 
              can increase more CO2 emissions than others. However, there is still costly carbon intensity abatement relative to a 
              counterfactual where the provinces meet their economic growth targets but in the absence of the intensity reduction 
              constraints. Policy implications have been proposed to enhance the efficiency and fairness of climate policy in China.

    abstract: High economic cost of climate policy has attracted critical debate since the Kyoto Protocol. 
              However, reliable empirical evidence of the abatement cost of green-house gases across countries remains scant.
              In this study we estimate the average yearly green-house gas abatement costs per capita for a panel of 28 OECD
              countries in years 1990–2015. The marginal abatement costs are estimated using a novel data-driven approach
              based on convex quantile regression. Compared to traditional frontier estimation methods, the quantile 
              approach takes into account a broader set of abatement options and is more robust to inefficiency, noise,
              and heteroscedasticity in empirical data. The comparison of OECD countries shows that the actual 
              abatement cost per capita has been very modest, much lower than predicted in the late 1990s. This 
              result has profound policy implications, calling for more ambitious climate change mitigation strategy in the future.

    abstract: Faced with the predicament of sustainable development in traditional cities, the low-carbon city, 
              as a novel urban development mode, provides a feasible idea for resolving the tensions among urban development, 
              resource conservation and environmental protection. Using prefecture-level panel data during 2007–2016, we adopt 
              the difference-in-differences model to explore the impact of low-carbon city construction on green growth. Afterward, 
              we estimate the heterogeneity of economic-environmental effects on cities, and those effects are attributed to different 
              scales and locations. The robustness tests reveal that low-carbon pilot cities significantly and continuously benefit 
              in terms of the green total factor productivity through technical effects being partly transformed into green technical
              progress and structural effects. Additionally, the construction of low-carbon cities has scale economy and regional 
              differences. Cities with larger scales, more complete infrastructure and better foundations for technology have more
              significantly positive effects on green growth. These findings also apply to cities in similar developing countries 
              seeking to achieve economic transformation and green growth.

    abstract: This paper analyzes regional inequality in Western China through a case study of Guangxi 
              Zhuang Autonomous Region from 1989 to 2012. We have found a recent trend of increasing county-level inequality, 
              in which the distribution of regional inequality has changed from a single peak to a bimodal pattern. 
              Based on the multi-mechanism framework, we have revealed that geographic environment and ethnic characteristics 
              have had a large impact on the economic development of Guangxi. Spatiality, investment and industrialization play
              an additional important role in regional development; meanwhile, globalization and decentralization play a minor role. 
              Building on the semiparametric geoadditive models, our investigation detects nonlinear relationships between geography, 
              ethnicity and local development. We then assess the relative performance of infrastructure and market potential
              to control for unobserved spatial heterogeneity.

    abstract: Eco-innovation has become a core engine for long-term stable economic development, 
              as well as a fundamental way to ease the tension between economic growth and environmental 
              resources management. Through the construction of a measurement index system, this paper 
              evaluates the level of regional eco-innovation in 30 Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2014. 
              This paper also employs panel data analysis to study the factors that influence Chinese regional eco-innovation. 
              The results show that, during the observation period, the levels of eco-innovation increased significantly overall. 
              However, the regional comparison of the eco-innovation index revealed an obvious, gradually decreasing distribution 
              pattern from east to west. Factors such as technology push, market pull, and environmental regulation pull
              have positive but differentiated influences on the eco-innovation throughout China and among the eastern, 
              central and western regions. Based on these heterogeneous influences and the targets of ecological civilization construction, 
              promoting the regional synergy of technology push, market pull, and environmental regulation pull is 
              necessary to improve the level of eco-innovation in China.

    abstract: Due to the lack of effective institutional constraints, the negative externality 
              from industrial production will lead to environmental pollution and spatial spillover on neighboring units.
              Because the self-purification capacity of the environmental system is limited, a strong time effect is witnessed. 
              Time lag and spatial spillover need to be considered to mitigate the effect of industrial pollution. 
              Using geographically weighted regression (GWR) and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR), 
              this paper decomposes the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of industrial pollution in China. Results show a significant 
              spatio-temporality in the evolution of the provincial-level industrial pollution since 2007. As the major participants, 
              state-owned enterprises play a leading role in the state economy and greatly affect pollutant emissions. In the central
              and eastern regions, an increasing proportion of state-owned output values is related to the decrease of industrial 
              pollution emissions, whereas western regions witness an opposite trend. Emissions charge plays a positive role in curbing 
              the emission from industrial enterprises in the central and western regions. A better understanding of the spatiotemporal 
              heterogeneity of industrial pollution is the prerequisite in the alleviation of industrial pollutions to achieve a sustainable economic growth.

    abstract: Shape-constrained nonparametric regression is a growing area in econometrics, statistics, 
              operations research, machine learning and related fields. In the field of productivity and efficiency analysis, 
              recent developments in the multivariate convex regression and related techniques such as convex quantile 
              regression and convex expectile regression have bridged the long-standing gap between the conventional 
              deterministic-nonparametric and stochastic-parametric methods. Unfortunately, the heavy computational
              burden and the lack of powerful, reliable, and fully open access computational package has slowed down
              the diffusion of these advanced estimation techniques to the empirical practice. The purpose of the 
              Python package pyStoNED is to address this challenge by providing a freely available and user-friendly
              tool for the multivariate convex regression, convex quantile regression, convex expectile regression, 
              isotonic regression, stochastic nonparametric envelopment of data, and related methods. This paper 
              presents a tutorial of the pyStoNED package and illustrates its application, focusing on the estimation 
              of frontier cost and production functions.

    abstract: The curse of dimensionality is a recognized challenge in nonparametric estimation. 
              This paper develops a new L0-norm regularization approach to the convex quantile and expectile regressions
              for subset variable selection. We show how to use mixed integer programming to solve the proposed L0-norm
              regularization approach in practice and build a link to the commonly used L1-norm regularization approach. 
              A Monte Carlo study is performed to compare the finite sample performances of the proposed L0-penalized 
              convex quantile and expectile regression approaches with the L1-norm regularization approaches. 
              The proposed approach is further applied to benchmark the sustainable development performance of 
              the OECD countries and empirically analyze the accuracy in the dimensionality reduction of variables. 
              The results from the simulation and application illustrate that the proposed L0-norm regularization 
              approach can more effectively address the curse of dimensionality than the L1-norm regularization 
              approach in multidimensional spaces.
